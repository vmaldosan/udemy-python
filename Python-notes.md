- There are no private attributes in Python classes. Every attribute is accessible and can be modified outside the class. Common practice is to prefix the attributes name with '_' to indicate that they shouldn't be accessed.

- In Python you don't need to **overload** methods: you only declare the one with all parameters and then you can use any of them by specifying their name or, if there's only one declaration, in order of appearance.
  If you overload a method, the last declaration of it would be the only one valid.

- Python is **dynamically typed**, so it's only interested in what how a variable behaves, instead of what it is.
